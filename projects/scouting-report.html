                                <p>Perennial powerhouse USC enters the NCAA championships as the No. 1 seed, hoping to capture its 10th title in program history. The Trojans have been hot of late – knocking off No. 3 Cal, No. 6 Stanford and No. 2 UCLA in recent weeks. They haven't lost since the Mountain Pacific Invitational in late September.</p>

                                <p>The team has succeeded in large part to its prolific offense, which currently leads the nation with 359 scores. Freshmen Matt Maier, Marin Dasic and Thomas Dunstan have combined for 67 goals. Furthermore, the Trojans have seven scorers with 20 or more goals this season.</p>

                                <p>Junior goalkeeper and Rio 2016 Olympian McQuin Baron anchors the USC defense. Using his 6'9" frame and lengthy wingspan, he has let in an average of only 4.31 goals per game this season and collected a season high 17 saves against No. 2 UCLA in the MPSF Championship match.</p>

                                <p>The key to defeating the Trojans lays in shutting down its top scorers. In its lone defeat this campaign to No. 3 California in late September, USC's top three goal scorers – Matteo Morelli and Blake and Lachlan Edwards – combined for only two goals.</p>

                                <p>The UCLA men's water polo team will have the chance to win its third straight NCAA Championship this upcoming weekend. This would be the Bruins' 11th title and the third during coach Adam Wright's time at the helm of the program.</p>

                                <p>The team reeled off 24 wins to begin the season, helping it set the NCAA record for consecutive wins with 57 straight victories. However, the Bruins fell twice to rival USC in the closing weeks of the campaign.</p>

                                <p>With seven players with 20 scores or more on the season, the Bruin offense depends on no one player for the bulk of its goals. Two players to look out for are senior attackers Ryder Roberts and Patrick Fellner – the pair have a combined 11 goals in the past 3 matches.</p>

                                <p>The defense, led by back to back MPSF Player of the Year Garrett Danner, has allowed six of fewer scores in 18 matches this year. The fifth-year goalie has averaged over 11 saves per game this year against Big 4 competition. </p>

                                <p>The path to beating UCLA starts with beating its defense early – in the two Bruin losses this year, the opponents took multi-goal leads in the first half and each time entered halftime with the lead.</p>

                                <p>No. 3 California earned an at-large bid into the NCAA Championship, the team now looking for the program's NCAA-leading 14th title. The Bears took 3rd in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championships with a 15-9 victory over rival No. 6 Stanford.</p>

                                <p>The squad is loaded with offensive playmakers – namely utility player Odysseas Masmanidis and attackers Johnny Hooper and Luca Cupido. Hooper, recently named All-MPSF first team, leads the team and the conference with 68 goals. Masmanidis, despite missing games in the early part of the season for international play, averaged 1.87 goals per game to score 28 times in 15 matches.</p>

                                <p>Defensively, the Bears are led by senior goalkeeper Lazar Andric. He leads all goalies in the conference with over 11 saves per contest and was named to the All-MPSF second team.</p>

                                <p>If Cal's high-powered offense can be tamed, the team can be defeated. In the squad's losses this campaign, Hooper averaged 1.5 goals per match and was held scoreless in two of the defeats.</p>

                                <p>He's the X factor – his performance largely determines the result for the Bears no matter who they're playing. His four goal performance was nearly enough to defeat No. 2 UCLA in the MPSF Championships and his four scores in the very next match downed the Cardinal.</p>

                                <p>Harvard clinched its first ever spot in NCAA national championship by winning the first ever Northeast Water Polo Conference (NWPC) Championship. The Crimson then earned its first NCAA Championship win by knocking off No. 12 Bucknell 13-12 Saturday afternoon, and will now move on to play No. 8 UC Davis Thursday at the Spieker Aquatics Complex in Berkeley, California.</p>

                                <p>The Crimson are led by senior attacker Noah Harrison, who with his 81 scores for the year has established himself as the primary offensive threat on the team. Harrison has scored in eight straight matches, with four scores each against No. 12 Princeton and MIT in the NWPC Championship.</p>

                                <p>Defensively, sophomore goalkeeper Anthony Ridgley and Harrison anchor the Crimson. Ridgley has 199 saves on the season, 26 of those came along with three steals and four assists in the NWPC Championship run. Harrison leads the team with 56 steals.</p>

                                <p>The key to taking down Harvard is to have a persistent offensive attack – in its six losses on the year, the Crimson gave up double digit goals in four of them.</p>

                                <p>Pomona-Pitzer clinched its automatic bid into the NCAA Championships with a 7-4 victory over the Claremont McKenna in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) postseason tournament finals.</p>

                                <p>The Sagehens are led offensively by sophomore utility player Adam Ward and senior attacker James Baker - the duo combined for 109 goals or 33.64% of the total offensive output. They combined for three scores and two steals in the SCIAC finals.</p>

                                <p>On the other end of the pool, junior goalkeeper Daniel Diemer has tallied 194 saves on the season. He had a steal and eight saves in the finals against Claremont McKenna.</p>

                                <p>The X factor for the Sagehens is Diemer - when he is not on the top of his game in the cage, the team struggles. In Pomona-Pitzer's eight losses, he gave up double digit scores in five of them.</p>
